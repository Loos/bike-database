#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Created by http://www.gitignore.io

### Vagrant ###

# proportion of contributors will probably not be using SublimeText
# *.sublime-project

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
